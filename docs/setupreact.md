# Set Up for React Plugins

Visual Studio 2022 has a **'Standalone JavaScript React Project' template, a 'Standalone TypeScript React Project' template, and 'React and ASP.NET Core' templates** for both JavaScript and TypeScript.  These templates set up ESLint, and the TypeScript Analyzer uses this set up **without any further configuration being necessary**.  This is discussed further in [a separate article](setupreacttemplate.md).  Note that these projects do NOT configure the full [React plugin for ESLint, eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react).  They use a more restricted set of rules, but do include the [react-hooks](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/README.md) and [react-refresh](https://github.com/ArnaudBarre/eslint-plugin-react-refresh) rules.

We can also set up React in other project types, and then set up the appropriate npm packages, including eslint-plugin-react, to allow the TypeScript Analyzer to lint it.  Another [separate article](setupreactnodeconsole.md) discusses this and shows how to set up the [React plugin for ESLint, eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) in **Node Console Applications** for both JavaScript and TypeScript.  This can be done in all versions of Visual Studio that are supported (2017, 2019 and 2022).  For the TypeScript Analyzer this means setting up a [local install](creatinglocalinstall.md) with the plugin, and a [configuration file](configuration.md) with appropriate rules enabled.
