# Changelog

These are the changes to each version that have been released
on Visual Studio Marketplace.

Version numbering started at 2.0 to avoid confusion with the old 
TypeScript Analyzer which was based on TSLint rather than ESLint.  
The old TypeScript Analyzer had version numbers with major version 
number of 1.

## 2.0
