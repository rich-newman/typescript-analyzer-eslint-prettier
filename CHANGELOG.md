# Changelog

These are the changes to each version that have been released
on Visual Studio Marketplace.

Version numbering started at 2.0 to avoid confusion with the old 
TypeScript Analyzer which was based on TSLint rather than ESLint.  
The old TypeScript Analyzer had version numbers with major version 
number of 1.

## 2.1

**TBD**

- Fix bug that crashes the webserver if linting using tsconfigs and there are comments in the JSON.
- Target .NET Framework 4.6 in Linter project rather than 4.6.1 so Visual Studio 2017 can run it without a targeting pack.
- Added documentation on using the Analyzer with Visual Studio's Angular project types.

## 2.0

**2022-05-16**

- Initial release
